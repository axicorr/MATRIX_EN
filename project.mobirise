Objectively, two fools are arguing: which of them is smarter? Unfortunately, this is not a metaphor, this is pathology. <b>Any humanitarian conflict is evidence of the mental incapacity of the parties</b>.<br><br>Third Axiom of Evolution: <b>“If someone finds meaning in what is useless for others, everyone is mistaken - only the Truth is necessary for everyone.”</b> Therefore, “Russian” is just as useless, if not detrimental, for “American”, as vice versa. And it is only madness to argue about what is meaningless for Life.<br><br><b>Politics, Business, and Love are self-satisfaction by agreeing to it.</b> The more consonants – the sweeter the pleasure. According to this formula, the “printing presses” of national, religious and other replication have been operating uncontrollably for thousands of years. Which led to Human Hyperinflation.<br><br>Copying is a prerequisite for survival, but only in the Pre-Intellectual World. In the world of Intelligence, it is a vital contraindication: to get a copy of the process, the process will have to be stopped. <b>Culture, Religion, and Nationalism are just some of the casts of Stopped Evolution</b>.<br><br>Yes, today they are losing even to Facebook. But then, it was those who became the first “social network” in the World, which offered Man TO HAVE FAR MORE THAN HE CAN. Man could not resist: <b>MENTAL COLLECTIVISM was approved by the Matrix of the Humanitarian World Order</b>.<br><br>And only after thousands of years, “suddenly” it turned out that these “puzzles” did not fit into a Single Picture. This is why it’s worrying: the likelihood that someone will try to “lap” them with nuclear weapons is all too obvious, which is natural when <b>“Have” is not enough for everyone.</b><br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

Even most Russians fail to narrow it all down to a clear target designation, which is more often called the “National Idea”.<br><br>In this connection, the demand for intellectual and humanitarian precision among Russians is practically absent: Russian hydraulics always leak; <b>Anyone who is diligent in their mind is cattle</b>; those who are “beat around the bush” – politicians and other “creative intelligentsia” – are the “Elite”. And what’s most important is that everyone is happy with it.<br><br>There is opposition, of course. As elsewhere, it serves as a marker of public sentiment. <b>But Her Russianness lies elsewhere</b>. Anyone in Russia who is not rich in talent; works anyhow but knows how not to work at all, can use it to change their social “registration” – to move to the “Political Elite”.<br><br>In general, <b>“Maximum Result with Minimum Effort” is the Formula of Evolution</b> and therefore the main behavioural motive of each Personality. But only the Communists were able to raise it to the level of collective behaviour at the level of secular sacredness when a criminal is ready to die for his executioner.<br><br>This catch, which then had neither citizenship nor nationality, predetermined the history of Mankind to this day. Having more than you can is too strong a temptation not to take advantage of it. <b>Thus, the Evolution of Vice began</b>.<b> </b>From the seed of Mental Collectivism, Nations, Religions, Cultures, Peoples and, of course, Russians sprouted.<br><br>And then everything is downhill. <b>The excitement of Collective Achievements provoked the Excessive Quantitative Growth</b> of “cultures” to the point of inevitably fencing Spiritual possessions with Physical borders. At least to maintain authenticity. And so that the greenhouse does not turn into a jungle, the vacancy of a “Gardener” arose here.<br><br>Formally, of course, this Position is assigned to God. That is, Man appointed God to take care of the Garden, which he received from Him as a gift... <b>Unfortunately and really, everyone wants and tries to be a “Gardener”</b>. Which, from the point of view of Evolution, is quite fair. And the Russians were very successful in this desire, if not surpassing the whole world.<br><br>Everything that deprives a Person of Self-Sufficiency is a Means of deliberately criminally involving Him in Dependency. Therefore, Lenin was right, but criminally dishonest when he called Religion “the opium of the people.” Because among ideological addictions, <b>even heroin is not a rival to Communism</b>.<br><br>It took Christianity more than two thousand years, Islam more than a millennium, and Communism only a few decades for 30% of humanity to make them their guides. Judging by Their material and spiritual strength, <b>the World of “Comrades” does not even consider Plan “B”.</b><br><br>In fairness, such a large gap in achievements lies not so much in the strength of Communism, but in the weakness of Religion, on which Man is less dependent than on the tax inspectorate. And there’s nothing to say about PC Games: <b>how many children in the world will throw a tantrum over the ban on praying?</b><br><br>However, <b>it was Communism that conquered the pinnacle of Perfection in the Evolution of the main Vice on the Planet </b>– Mental Collectivism. And soon He ascended to Olympus: in 1917, power on 1/6 of the inhabited landmass was seized by the Bolsheviks in Form and the Poor in Content.<b><br></b><br>But, if all the Ideologies of Collectivism slow down, and only at a maximum, stop the Intelligence Evolution, then <b>in the Soviets Land the Intelligence, together with the rivers, was turned back</b>. This is the hidden “victorious” toxicity of Communism over all its fellow Democrats, Liberals, Anarchists and others.<br><br>The dose of Collectivism introduced by Communism to the Russian Proletariat seemed Victorious to both but turned out to be fatal for both. Pleasure at the cost of Death - this is how all drug addicts die. <b>That is why the Soviet Land was born so quickly and died so early.</b> The only pity is that the USSR didn’t die a natural death.<br><br>Every Quantity has a Growth Limit, beyond which it becomes toxic to itself. <b>That is why all Empires are doomed to collapse</b>. Trying to destroy them ahead of schedule will only prolong their life. Nothing wakes you up from your “sleep” more than the threat to the life or sacrificial death of a fellow man.<br><br>The intentional collapse of the USSR was no exception to the rule. Having destroyed the country of the Soviets, <b>Western Democracy revived the Russian Empire</b> in the person of the Russian World, whose global behaviour is becoming more and more in tune with the ambitions of influential Players in the International Arena.<br><br><b>The collapse of the USSR freed Soviet Ideology from the burden of denying religions</b>. For the rest, her social concept is an almost absolute model of Collectivism. Which, combined with considerable resources, pushed the Old World and the Global South to move closer to New Russia.<br><br>And yet, the “chemistry” of these relations lies in the “analogism” of the Parties. <b>99% of Collectivism adherents are a priori incapable of evolving personally</b>. Therefore, the bright displays of the “Digital Worlds” do not cause anything in them except an exacerbation of chronic snobbery to insane levels. And making friends with an illness is tiring even for the most desperate masochists.<br><br>Moreover, huge Natural Resources make it possible to buy technical innovations without much mental effort. <b>Against the backdrop of the global depletion of digital progress</b>, a change of course towards friendship with peers is already an Objective pattern. No matter how much you feed the wolf, he will be friends with the Forest.<br><br>And the Vassals will become Lords. The “Digital Worlds” will serve the “Analog Worlds” until the last “Scientist”. Alas, <b>if a Man takes up the Mind, then the Bolshevik only takes up the revolver. </b>The Russian Bolsheviks have already taken up their revolver. Next in line are the Chinese Bolsheviks, and then the Arab ones.<br><br>Alas, it hurts, but it’s natural. If the Creator needed a Party or a Nation, he would not have created a mechanism of genetic uniqueness – everyone would have been born Muslims or Republicans at once and the World would have lived in absolute Unity. Therefore, <b>it is foolish to do what God does not do</b>.<br><br>It is even greater stupidity to blame God for imperfection, naively believing that He did not take care of protecting His Plan from any Threats. “Everyone who finds meaning in what is useless for others self-destructs in the standoff to it” – <b>the Centrifuge of Mental Evolution or the most Perfect minefield on the Planet</b>.<br><br>Judging by the fact that God has not yet personally intervened in any of the humanitarian confrontations, the Centrifuge works as intended, flawlessly responding to any Mental Excess. But something else is striking: <b>Man’s suicidal desire to Rule – to Have More than You Can.</b><br><br>Although, it cannot be otherwise. <b>Any Ideology does not need People, but Members</b>. Because the Socialization of Man for himself is the only way to survive for any Authority, without exception. The only difference is in the dose of Collectivism: for Democracy it is less, for Communism it is absolute.<br><br>Democracy tries to dominate the public consciousness of Man without violating his internal freedoms and personal space. Two behaviours in one Person is an unfavourable indicator even from a medical point of view. From the point of view of Evolution, <b>a plane made “well” is already a bomb</b>.<br><br><b>Communism wanted to split on personal freedoms or personal space</b> - It should be everywhere - an honest man has nothing to hide. And in this, the Communists were incredibly close to the Truth because the boundaries of a Self-sufficient Man are his Brain. But, naturally, They could not know this.<br><br>Therefore, as a first step, the Communists banned their closest competitor – Religion, and as a second step,<b> they abolished Intellect </b>– positions in the Soviet Union were given not to those devoted to science, but to those loyal to Communism. Well, the main mission – Collectivization itself – was entrusted to the “Creative Intelligentsia”, also appointed from the Proletarians.<br><br>By the way, Russians still don’t understand that all this humanitarian dandruff is the worst enemy of any Ideology. Indeed, in terms of their content, <b>the Elite, who copies Creativity, are deeply unhappy people</b> who are unable to live their own lives, therefore they live the lives of others. They are neither physically nor mentally – DEAD SOULS.<br><br>There were times when singing at the feet of the Lords was their greatest reward. But <b>Power has fallen in price from Command to Equality</b>. Nowadays it is becoming increasingly difficult to understand who is singing to whom. What is quite natural is that the jesters have been exhorted for the hegemony of the Power for so long and blithely that some of them are even trying to be It.<br><br>Perhaps the Bolsheviks anticipated similar impudence of the Proletarian Elite. But <b>it is possible to force a Man to part with his Thoughts only by “offering” him to savour the Thoughts of others.</b> Whether it’s good or bad, but apart from “Art” and without coercion, no one else in the World knows how to do this.<br><br>And this is not a statement, but a delusion of all Politicians. <b>Therefore, those who sow bread live worse than those who draw bread</b>. In fact, Art, and even then in part, is only Music. Only Music is a Well-being, and not a Landmark, like a Song that “kills” both Music and Man. \n<br><br><b>Everything else – painting, poetry, sculpture, theatre, and cinema are Criminal Craft and ritual junk in the coffin of Human Self-Sufficiency. And it doesn’t matter which country.</b><br><br>Not less, as the Great Insight was the attitude to Art, declared in Islam. But the World «did not notice it». But Russia has noticed something. <b>Russia’s genuine interest in Islam’s moral achievements in Chechnya</b> evoked a lively response from the whole of World Islam.<br><br>Unlike all currently existing ideologies, used from time to time, <b>Islam is the only worldview, the spiritual component of which ensures statehood at the level of the material component</b>. This means that the predisposition to unity not for money among people professing Islam is an order of magnitude higher than among people of other faiths.<br><br>Islam has never received a greater sign of attention in its entire History, first of all. And secondly, this is practically a green light to the Great Caliphate, albeit within the framework of the Multipolar World. Multipolar World is a new “trade” sign, under the name of which Mental Equality, which is in great demand in the Old World and the Global South, is now sold. <b>Communism 2.0 is sweeping the Planet</b>.<br><br>To become the New World, and not be reflected in His winds - such a chance, of course, will not be missed by the Old World. In general, the event is revolutionary. And yet, <b>this is not even a claim to a New World Order – the Order remains Old, only the Authority changes</b>. And the World is still Ruled by Collectivism.<br><br>Of course, if “Russian-Arab Democracy” should take place as an Evolutionary experiment, so be it. But, if the fate of Mental Collectivism is already predetermined, this means that Man has a rare opportunity not to hasten the inevitable. One has only to give up Excessive Intentions.<br><br>Meanwhile, no one even declares their intentions to break out of the Captivity of Mental Collectivism. But these, coupled with the nationalized “Art” and “Education”, are <b>alarming Markers of the Global Stop of Humanitarian Evolution</b>.<br><br>In such conditions, everyone survives due to the Inertia of Achievement. The New World relies exclusively on the Achievements of Technical Progress. However, even Children know that <b>Humanitarian Evolution and Technical Progress are practically not identical</b> – dismantling the Original to create a worthless Copy is not even Art.<br><br>Having lost to Technical Progress, Russia retained significant Natural Resources, the inertia of which is sufficient to survive the New World, but insufficient to preserve Statehood. And this is not a threat to either Russia in particular or the World in general. This is inevitable - <b>Evolution does not tolerate Consumers.</b><br><b><br></b>\"If the fight is inevitable, be the first to hit\" – words of the President of Russia. But from the point of Evolution's view, everything is much simpler: if Man takes up the Mind, then the Bolsheviks take up the Revolver.<b> If a Man views War as an extreme Solution, it is not the Solutions that have ended—the Man has ended</b>.<br><br><b>The War in Ukraine unleashed by Russia, followed by the armed rebellion of the Private Military Company, revealed the malignant inability of the Russian Government to Evolve and the absolute helplessness of the World to defend the Peace.</b><br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

Therefore, the \"capital\" of Ukrainians is always abroad. However, what is happening to them is not a story about Ukraine, but just a <b>“teaser trailer” for the upcoming fate of all who profess the current World Order Rules</b>. \n<br><br>Mental Collectivism, better known by pseudonyms: State, Opposition, Religion, Nation, Culture and so on – is <b>an IDEOLOGICAL PYRAMID, the growth into plus of which is possible only at the expense of someone's growth into minus. </b>That’s why today in the cemetery of History is a holiday: if there is no one else to go into minus, the turn of the Empires comes.<br><br>And regardless of whether it is a conspiracy or a fraud, all ideological pyramids are doomed. But if for their Apologists this is a disaster, then<b> for Evolution it is a Vacancy</b>. And this time it is the top: the Pyramid of all pyramids – Mental Collectivism – goes into the minus. De facto, this is happening in Ukraine.<br><br><b>Democracy, Fascism, Communism, Capitalism, Islam, Christianity and other Collective Worldviews are the only children of MENTAL COLLECTIVISM</b>, which is the common denominator, unit of measurement and root system for all ideologies and religions of the World without exception.<br><br><b>The decision to “cut off” not a branch, but an entire trunk, turned out to be fatal for the entire Tree</b>. The liquidation of the Soviet Union became indirect, and the birth of Independent Ukraine became a direct catalyst for the chain collapse of all Institutes of Collectivism. And Ukrainian localization is not at all providential.<br><br>Light in the house through common efforts and “today”, against hard labour at the splinter in prayers for paradise, but “tomorrow” is<b> the uncontested “drug” of Mental Collectivism</b>. Ukraine could not cope with this monster, because before the “marriage” to the USSR it was not “sick” with either Faith or Money, and therefore did not have Immunity to Collectivism.<br><br><b>Which led to the particular severity of the addiction</b>. Among all the descendants of the USSR, it is the Soviet Ukrainians who still think, work, and dream in the Soviet way. True, they want to HAVE in a European way – not too much to assimilate into the new space.<br><br>But all this is nothing compared to <b>Soviet-style education, which is alive and well in Ukraine to this day.</b> Modern indicators of the level of formalism in Ukrainian education are much higher than Soviet indicators and are practically close to absolute, even to the point of denying Knowledge in general.<br><br>Alas, thirty years later it no longer seems strange why the support from the “highly educated” Western Democracy turned out to be pies, and not an “obstetrician” capable of cutting the umbilical cord of Soviet education in the Newborn Ukraine. <b>A sick person is no help to a sick person</b>.<br><br>Material Corruption is an objective phenomenon for all forms of Collectivism. It is born with every new Family, therefore she is eternal and omnipresent. <b>A greater volume of SELF-SELF COMPROMISE than in the Family exists only in Communism</b>, which gave rise to a special Corruption – Humanitarian Corruption.<br><br>It is possible to organize a team only around an idea, a goal, or a Divinity. And since Communism denies God, <b>it appointed as its Divinity a Man</b> who first worked and now lives for his pleasure – Authority, i.e. Therefore, Soviet people do everything possible to avoid working.<br><br>Thus, Humanitarian Corruption was born in the USSR, turning any work into a Formality, which, coupled with decent material resources, created in Ukraine the illusion of being in Paradise in the literal and figurative sense. Therefore, <b>Ukraine did not get out of the “warm bed”</b>, but there was no one to force It.<br><br>There is no point in calculating Ukraine's labour losses over thirty years in the Soviet dream. Now the whole point is one thing: how to live further. <b>The ideological inertia of Communism has practically exhausted itself</b>. And Ukraine has never had and does not have any other means of “moving” through Life.<br><br>Providence or coincidence, but <b>the inertia of Christianity is also running out</b>. The simplicity with which Religions are prohibited in Ukraine, and this does not cause a religious uprising, speaks only of one thing: Religion for Ukrainians is the same formality as Education and Labor.<br><br>The state of civil ideologies in Ukraine is in even greater decline. And to navigate in “hell” if you were born in “heaven” – this takes centuries, which no one has now. And <b>if Democracy invests only Weapons and Money in Ukraine, this means that it has nothing else to offer besides Death.</b><br><br>Alas, Time itself testifies: it is almost impossible to compete with Soviet “opium”, for the “use” of which they could even give you an apartment. <b>The futile attempts of the international community to rehabilitate the Ukrainian Consciousness only aggravate the suffering of the Ukraine Body.</b><br><br>And the final touch. In the stream of ideological bankruptcies, <b>Statehood itself, like all steel forms of Mental Collectivism, is also living out its last days</b>. Having deprived himself of the Only Objective Right to Free Movement, Man lowered himself evolutionarily lower than the Beast.<br><br>Ukraine has never been a self-sufficient State and has never considered Man worse than the Beast. Despite conceivable and unimaginable intrigues to draw her into the womb of Mental Collectivism, she went through all its vices but remained Ideologically Immaculate - <b>Itself fell into sin but did not force others</b>.<br><br>Today's Ukraine is not yet capable of Healthy Dominion, which means self-control. But Ukraine never suffered from Pathological Dominance – to own others. Yes, being under “someone” is not always pleasant. But <b>only Sinners become Righteous</b>. It’s painful and annoying, but Sin is an integral part of Evolution.<b><br></b><br>Therefore, <b>it is impossible to prohibit Sin a priori</b>. In Ukraine, there is nothing and no one to ban Sin. Because, like Education, Religion and everything else that is not in “Authority”, the Law in Ukraine is also a Formality. Which, in the end, predetermined the Ukrainian localization of all the humanitarian vices of the World.<br><br>Collecting all the “diseases” in one place is the last, of all possible, test options for both Diseases and Place. <b>Once upon a time, a Man went through such a test.\n</b><br>\n<br><b>Isaiah 53:4-6</b> <b>“</b>4 Surely he took up our pain and bore our suffering, yet we considered him punished by God, stricken by him, and afflicted. 5 But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed. 6 We all, like sheep, have gone astray, each of us has turned to our own way; and the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all”.<br><br><b>Now the time has come for the State</b>, or more precisely, the Place, which has become for the World the Centrifuge of Excess and the axis of the Revival of the Natural World Order, in which everyone who finds meaning in what is meaningless for others will self-destruct in this confrontation.<br><br><b>Now the time has come for the State</b>, or more precisely, the Place, which has become for the World the Centrifuge of Excess and the axis of the Revival of the Natural World Order, in which EVERYONE WHO FINDS MEANING IN WHAT IS MEANINGLESS FOR OTHERS WILL SELF-DESTRUCT IN THIS CONFRONTATION.<br><br><b>GOD is not a well-dressed loan shark – HE doesn’t need copies.</b><br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

The phrase is, to put it mildly, loose. Especially when you consider that <b>God does not use either the dollar</b> in particular or Money, in general, a priori.<br><br>However, no one put any calculation into this saying to so exquisitely attract the attention of the Creator. The real mission of the phrase is to make the Dollar itself a Deity. This is what happened: <b>the dollar today is no longer money, it is a life guide</b>. What, in fact, was the beginning of His end and the end of Great America.<br><br><b>If you turn a tool into a deity, both will stop working</b>. In addition, every Quantity has a Growth Limit. And the Dollar is no exception. Although, unlike its value, its Sacredness has not yet been exhausted: The US debt is greater than its value, but many in the world still trust it.<br><br>And yet, sacredness is also an inflationary thing. Today, <b>the efficiency of “thirty pieces of silver” is beyond the reach of even billions</b>. And this means not only that since then Money has been worth less and less, and more and more of it is needed. First of all, this suggests that the United States does not have an Ideology capable of providing Money with decent Work, other than Lending.<br><br><b>The rapid reduction of the distance between \"I want\" and \"I have\"</b>, synthesized primarily by social, humanitarian and financial loans, makes long-term projects, including religious ones, uninteresting for society. That's why the queue to the prostitute is much longer than the queue to the monastery gate.<br><br>As a result, the requests of any modern nation are not higher than the \"stomach\" level. Therefore, today it is so difficult to organize the Mind to build and it is so simple to excite It to destroy. <b>Anarchy becomes the usual state of society</b>, regardless of its material state.<br><br>Consuming is always easier and cheaper than creating. Therefore, <b>the Mind, with the abandoned Will to Creativity, extremely quickly \"sits\" on social dividends</b>. And soon he wants to receive them not only as \"a possible\" and demand as \"an ought\", but also to take away them as \"an own\".<br><br>It is in this is the whole malignancy of Collectivism, including Democracy, the demand for which is no longer possible without coercion. And there is nothing strange in this: <b>Western Education does not have sufficient skills to recognize the expiration date of this Ideology</b>, after which It has become toxic.<br><br>In fact, <b>all Collectivist Ideologies are toxic from “birth”</b> only because they are not able to reproduce mentally, therefore they survive exclusively through cloning and only in conditions of an ideological vacuum to prevent loss of authenticity.<br><br>Although, such precautions are like a poultice for the dead. Death has already taken place because <b>any mental cloning is a conscious rejection of Evolution – a kind of Humanitarian Suicide</b>. Yes, Man is capable of destroying any obstacles to the intended goal. But if Evolution turns out to be an obstacle, then the Goal will destroy Man.<br><br>The discovery of wireless data transmission put an end to this “anaerobic” story. Physical boundaries have ceased to guarantee any mental stability and sacred integrity of all Ideologies without exception.<b> Thus began the Great Confusion of Ideologies and the collapse of Mental Collectivism.</b><br><br>The suddenly formed «Space Deficit» on “one’s own territory” is just one of the catalysts for the objective confrontation not only between Ideologies but also within Them. Therefore, <b>the US strategic reliance on the “geographical” invulnerability of its Democracy is self-deception at best.</b><br><br><b><br>Democracy according to the US recipe is a very difficult puzzle</b>, for which even its owner does not have clear solutions. And yet, if we consider this Lady under her real name – Controlled Anarchy, everything becomes clear in an instant.<br><br><b>Democracy is perhaps one of the best ideological decisions of Man</b>. But, alas, solely due to side effects, which makes Democracy an excellent analgesic and a bad medicine with absolute contraindications for constant use.<br><br>The next nail in the “coffin” of Western Civilization is <b>the attempt to imitate Evolution with the help of Technical “Progress”</b>. As a result, artificial Intelligence has made Man so cheap that for the most part, Humanitarian Inflation on the Planet is already irreversible.<br><br><b>The physical mass of the United States, including national debt, is more than $50 trillion</b>. The metaphysical mass is a slogan far from the Truth: “We believe in God.” Some people see a material surplus in this ratio, others – a spiritual deficit.<br><br>In the language of the average person, this suggests that they are capable of a lot «for money». But «for free» they will never raise their soldiers to «The Attack of the Dead Mans». Alas, “overweight” is not compatible with the Feat that is Evolution. Therefore, <b>when you have a lot of money, it doesn’t matter whether you believe in God. What’s more important is whether he believes in you.</b><br><br>An elderly teenager is the functional state of the United States, in particular, and the entire Democratic World in general. Of course, for science, it is a research paradise, but for Evolution it is an emasculated family or an exhausted project. <b>If there is order in the House, this means that there is no Childhood in it.</b><br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

For billions of years, this method eliminates the occurrence of Claims and guarantees the Evolution of Everything Quality on the Planet. Except for Man, of course.<br><br><b>Having allowed himself Collectivism, Man “cast” the Ax of War</b>. Since then for Man, War, like any other humanitarian confrontation, is a means to achieve a goal. For Evolution, this is a symptom of Mental Incapacity, which is enough to exclude the “sick” from the list of “invited” to evolve.<br><br>And judging by the fact that <b>War is increasingly becoming the last instrument of “Reconciliation”</b>, this disease has long turned from chronic to malignant. Which, in general, is not surprising and natural when there is a lot of Strength and little Intelligence. Alas, pumping up muscles is always easier than “pumping up” the brain tracks.<br><br>Although, in recent decades, no one has been “pumping” either the brain or the muscles anywhere. <b>Everyone is pumping oil and bitcoins – naively believing that their Power is enough not only not to think and not to work,</b> but also to rule over everyone else who is unlucky with “hydrocarbons”. At the same time, no one takes into account one detail.<br><br>Since the moment of renunciation of Evolution, <b>Man has lost the natural Right to dispose of its resources de jure.</b> De facto, He declared War on his creditor – a common human practice, which in the case of Evolution also means burning the chair you are sitting on.<br><br>War is already a “natural” state of a society simulating peace. And <b>the problem is not that the rich share the oil</b>. The trouble is that the poor begin to share the work. These are the consequences of political globalization, unfolding against the backdrop of a manic confrontation between all kinds of ideologies for the right to rule.<br><br>In general, and in the presence of a myriad of “scientists”, it may seem strange: <b>why all these expansionists do not even propose, but impose their Rules</b> on the World instead of looking for a Compromise of Worldviews. Here, either there is something wrong with the “scientists”, or the Coexistence of Achievements is impossible at all.<br><br>In fact, the only victims of any War should be exclusively scientists <b>who are trying to build straight walls on a crooked foundation</b>. Not soldiers, and not even politicians, but the humanities bear full responsibility for the billions who have not known the Truth.<br><br>Of course, <b>there has never been “the Fall” of world philosophy – it was born as a “pervert”</b>. But it is in this precisely Its main mission - to purify herself, for this is the only way to show the True Path to others. And although breaking a mirror will not make you more beautiful, the “scientific” world tirelessly rejects what belongs to others to protect its own.<br><br><b>De jure The same Church promised to be the Guide</b>. This means that in the 21st century, the Enlightenment Thought of the Church should be ahead of the functional abilities of the latest iPhone version, at least a step at minimum. De facto, the world has received yet another wedding and funeral bureau with a props-up of sacrality.<br><br>That’s why children rush to the virtual world, and not to the church world, which has long ago and hopelessly lost to its digital “colleague” both in form and content. <b>This is where the “evil spirit” is born – a sophisticated compulsion to voluntarily love something that you do not understand</b>. Except how to force respect for the “inexplicable” is impossible neither in religion nor in science.<br><br>But <b>if there are no mushrooms in the basket, this does not mean that they are not in the forest</b>. At this point, another circumstance arises that discourages even the most skilled mushroom pickers from wanting “to SEARCH” at any cost. Unlike Man, who lives by Theorems, the “Forest” lives exclusively by Axioms. And this is the greatest problem in the relationship between Evolution and Man.<br><br>Entire galaxies of creative, working, bureaucratic and other “intelligentsia” hang around the Theorems. And with Axiom, you won’t “get fat” yourself and you won’t spoil your relative with “fat.” This, in principle, explains why <b>the queue is always for the Positions and never for the Righteous</b>.<br><br>And there would be no end to this if not for the Age of Aquarius. Whether it's providence, a joke or a coincidence, it doesn't matter. <b>Every Theorem lives as long as someone defends It</b>. Therefore, the Axiom is eternal Peace and eternal Life, and the Theorem is eternal War and Death.<br><br>Evolution would not have been like this if it had not foreseen that the minimum of this World in the hands of Man is to be disassembled for parts on sale; at most – to be lit by nuclear fireworks at the Elite Party. In this regard, <b>a genius simple automatic Fuse was set in the Intellect</b>.<br><br><b>“Everyone who finds meaning in what is meaningless for others – self-destructs in a stand-off to this”</b> – The Third Axiom of Evolution, Creativity, Collectivism and Perfection. Truly, it is not an evil spirit or even an Adversary that kills a Man, but the banal desire to Own to Rule.<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

Which is the absolute argument of Her Perfection and the guarantor of unconditional trust in Her. Otherwise, Man was either skillfully deceived, or He deliberately used a stillborn product.<br><br>Due to the fact that <b>Mental Collectivism is a common BEHAVIOURAL PATTERN</b>, it is already incompatible with Evolution objectively. Therefore, “making friends” immutable Statics of Collectivism with Evolutionary Dynamics of Personality – has always been very difficult.<br><br><b>Religion guards its Patterns with special ferocity</b>. This is more than natural: if a Man takes up the Mind, the Bolshevik (COLLECTIVIST) takes up the Revolver. Although, according to its essential purpose, and even more so with such Powers, unless, of course, this is Deception, everything should be exactly the opposite.<br><br>The same story in the Secular World is not so dramatic. But, <b>in the phrase “We will contact you,” much more “Heretics” “burned” than at the fires of the Holy Inquisition</b>. But when the World Ideologies “suddenly” realized the need for their Modernization, it turned out that there was no one to do this, but there was no need anymore.<b><br></b><br><b>Economic Globalization, followed by Technical Progress, launched the process of Political Globalization</b>. This does not greatly affect the integrity of state borders. But, maintaining the boundaries of Worldviews in such conditions is almost impossible. Even with the help of the Bolshevik Revolver.<br><br>And although the Rapprochement of Religions, Cultures, and Nations is the Highest Stage of Development of the Collectivism Ideologies, only those who do not have the opportunity to do so want to achieve it. Those who have such an opportunity, have no desire at all – <b>nothing trims the Authority so much as the movement towards Unity</b>.<br><br>This is where such an unprecedented surge in rapprochement comes from. Or rather, its Imitations in the Old World. They receive wheat as a help. They are also looking forward to the energy and technological aid but not assistance. With all this, they have money for weapons. Probably, <b>these guys feel that the Highest Stage of Development is also the Breakdown Point</b>.<br><br>The only problem is that showing a cheap performance in a crowded hall with a shortage of popcorn and cola is fraught with danger for the Actors, the Spectators, and the Hall. <b>The density of the Mixing of Worldviews has reached critical levels</b>. That’s why the World is so often on fire.<br><br><b>Religions, Cultures, and Nations no longer have the opportunity to live separately, but to live together does not yet have the same Desire</b>. The solution to this problem was once entrusted to Monotheism. But, like all other attempts, this one turned into a farce: everyone recognizes one God but professes different Laws.<br><br>Although <b>Synchronizing Desires with Possibilities is not difficult</b>. Only this must be done not in relation to Society and not from the point of view of Power, as Collectivism does. And to do this only in relation to the Personality and from the point view of Competencies - Qualifications, which Collectivism cannot and will not do.<br><br><b>Any Qualitative Growth of a Person increases His Personification level in Society</b>. If this is an Applied Qualification, Society receives a Professional, to retain whom it will be necessary to sacrifice Power – to accept His conditions. Otherwise, the Society will lose a Member. And so, he only makes himself a competitor.<br><br>If this is a Mental Qualification, Society receives a classic “Heretic”, whose revisionism and innovation are a bone in the throat of any Ideology. And <b>when everyone wants Peace, but everyone on their Terms, this is an inevitable War,</b> the scale of which depends on the scale of Interests.<br><br>Formally, the map of conflicts on the Planet is outlined by the borders of States. However, none of these confrontations has either a local or a global solution, for the information of those interested. <b>Quantitative changes in the formula values do not affect its Quality in any way</b>.<br><br>The way out of the situation is obvious: no war can be cancelled or rewind. But to replace the Formula, or rather - change it to Axioma – would be very useful. And <b>this is not a ticket to the Future – It has long come</b>. The current task is not to be «dropped» from Evolution Train, so as not to start Life with nuclear winter.<br><br><b>SURVIVING today is the “reanimation” of Humanitarian Evolution</b> and the resumption of Human participation in the Evolution of the Universe, and not in the camel race. The condition is still the same: to reproduce the Qualitative State of Man, capable of ensuring His Personal Self-Sufficiency. This is theoretical.<br><br>In practice in the conditions of the Global Confusion of Worldviews, <b>any attempt to synchronize a Person with any Society is more often harmful than useless</b>. Therefore, the abolition of the Institutes of Socialization will not only relieve Humanitarian Tension but will also free up a colossal amount of resources.<br><br>And this does not create any emptiness or vacuum - <b>the removal of Excess never causes Deficit</b>. And getting rid of the Mediator is only additional Profit, which will be in excess enough to synchronize Man not with Society or the State, but with Evolution.<br><br>In general, replacing Mental Collectivism with <b>the Doctrine of Evolution is practically a “transplant” of the New World Order</b>. It will happen in any case: either naturally, i.e. without “pain relief”; or with some sedative advance - by the goodwill of the Person.<br><br>Of course, the Doctrine of Evolution is not without its shortcomings, otherwise, It would have stopped already. But what Man is guided by is not even comparable to Her, if only because <b>without Democracy or Christianity, Communism or Judaism, Nature has been successful for billions of years</b>. But without Nature, they are worth nothing at all.<br><br>Therefore, and in the conditions of the Global Confusion of Worldviews, <b>the Doctrine of Evolution is an objectively acceptable guideline of Unity for any Worldview</b>; and a sufficient guarantor of the Personal Freedoms of Man, limited only by His capabilities and demands from Society.<br><br>And since <b>the only Result of Evolution is a Process</b> that is not at all compatible with Collectivism, this ensures the ideological security of the Doctrine at a level sufficient to simply outlive all ideological competitors in Time.<br><br>The functionality of the Doctrine of Evolution depends only on the degree of its implementation in the State Ideology. This implies the replacement of the Constitutional or Social Contract with <b>a Personal Contract between Man and the State</b>.<br><br>Price. Of course, all this could have happened long ago and with much less losses. But <b>this does not make the Solution itself either simpler or more complex</b>. As before, Man needs to accept the fact that all His Rules need calibration, or, more simply, urgent replacement.<br><br>It is worth noting that since in the Doctrine of Evolution the Necessary is guaranteed to be free, and payment is charged only for the Desired, <b>you will have to invest much more Courage in this Decision than Money</b>. Of course, the carriers of the Healthy Dominance virus – those who Rule over Themselves – will not have to invest.<br><br>But for those “infected” with Pathological Dominance – those who Rule over Others – <b>this is a rare opportunity to reclassify Vice into Mission</b>. You shouldn’t expect universal insight from her, but she guarantees sufficient “tectonic” activity.<br><br><b>The tectonic plate of the current World Order – Mental Collectivism – has long been riddled with deep Cracks</b>. Therefore, one well-aimed movement at the point of greatest tension will destroy it forever. And this is no longer a question of Time but of Decision. The main thing is not to end up under Her ruins. But it is also stupid to destroy an old house without building a new one.<br><br><b>The world does not need a Global Master because that would involve slavery. But the World will not survive without a Unified Ideology of Global Cohabitation.</b><br><br><br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",
